--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--#1-How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    ;

--#2-How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
    WHERE Product LIKE '%iPhone%'
    ;

--#3-Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
    ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
    ;

--#4-Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct(Product), Price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY Product
    ORDER BY Price ASC
    LIMIT 1
    ;
    
--#5-What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*Price AS Total_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY Product
    ;

--#6-Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*Price AS Total_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY Product
    ;

--#7-How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February? What was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum), AVG(Quantity)*Price FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
    ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
    WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
    ;

--#8-List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
    GROUP BY product
    ;

--#9-How many locations are there in New York that sold more than 1 product in January?
SELECT COUNT(distinct location) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
    AND quantity > 1
    ;
